  "summary": [
    "The White House advised all Americans to avoid groups of more than 10 and urged older people to stay at home in a set of new guidelines designed to fight a spreading coronavirus outbreak.",
    "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, were among the officials pressing for the White House to issue more strenuous guidelines to slow the spread of the virus, based on data from new tests and updated modeling.",
    "Still, the guidelines issued on Monday were only recommendations and not mandates. Most are steps public health officials have been pushing since the start of the outbreak, including staying home from work when feeling sick and avoiding discretionary travel."
